# Password manager
Please keep in mind that this is my first project using Github and my first time using tkinter too. I have also never compiled or made an installer for any of my programs before.

This is a basic password manager that saves passwords in a png image. It does this by saving data in the binary representation of each color value of an image (This uses RGBA for more data storage to be specific).
